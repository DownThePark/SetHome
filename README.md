# SetHome

### Introduction
Looking for a simple set-home plugin? One without permissions, maybe? Well, you've come to the right place! SetHome is a lightweight plugin designed to do a few things.

SetHome allows your players to:
- Set a home for themselves. 
- Go to their home.
- Delete their home.

This plugin saves each player's home into its own file under the "plugins/SetHome/homes" folder.
