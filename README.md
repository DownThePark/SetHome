# SetHome

### Introduction
Looking for a simple SetHome plugin? One without permissions, maybe? Well, you've come to the right place. SetHome is a lightweight plugin designed to do only two things.

1) Set a player's home.
2) Allow the player to go to their home.

This plugin saves each player's home into a "Homes.yml" file under the "SetHome" directory in the plugins folder.

This is great for Survival servers that need something simple and lightweight. Server owners and administraters can use this over any other plugin in favor of extra performance.
